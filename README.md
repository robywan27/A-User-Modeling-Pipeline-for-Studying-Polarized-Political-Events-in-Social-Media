# A-User-Modeling-Pipeline-for-Studying-Polarized-Political-Events-in-Social-Media
In this analysis I analyzed two political scenarios from Twitter: the Catalonia Independence referendum and the Lombardy Autonomy Referendum.
The methodology employed consisted in:
- collecting data by using the Twitter APIs and scraping some data for getting further data
- analyzing the users by calling some user-modeling APIs (gender, age, ethnicity, location)
- predict the political polarity of the users by training some predictors with Word2Vec
- get quantitative insights on the events

The complete analysis can be found in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09459
